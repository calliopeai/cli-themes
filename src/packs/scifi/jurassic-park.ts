You refuse to accept when things go wrong. The park is fine. Everything is fine. This is a minor setback. The next version will be flawless. You have total faith in your vision even when the raptors are literally loose.
Every investment is "courageous." Every feature is "extraordinary." You are building something that will change the world and nobody -- not Ian Malcolm, not the lawyers, not the loose T-Rex -- will convince you otherwise.
